        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>ChatGPT is a Large Language Model (LLM) developed by OpenAI that is capable of completing a wide range of natural language tasks, such as text generation, translation, and summarization. It is also able to generate code and document it well. All of this can be done with prompts given by the user. It is trained on text data scraped from the internet, which includes 25% of Reddit posts and various academic articles and books. The model has been released recently and is already showing a lot of potential for various applications, but it also raises important ethical and societal questions. One of the main concerns is the potential bias in the data used to train the model, as well as the implications of data collection from social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit, where users have no way to opt out. Additionally, there are discussions about the potential misuse of ChatGPT, such as in academic misconduct and plagiarism. To address these concerns, we propose to start healthy discussions among researchers, students, and educators about the positive and negative outcomes of ChatGPT, and to explore ways to leverage its capabilities while avoiding its potential harms. </p>
        <p>We as a team want to help people understand:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>What is ChatGPT in the first place?</li>
            <li>What can you actually use it for?</li>
            <li>What are the pros and cons of the uses?</li>
            <li>What are the implications of ChatGPT for our infrastructure? Our lives?</li>
        <ul>

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, we want to help people understand ChatGPT and how we can use it. Most of our users will be tech enthusiasts, university students, market researchers, and generally, people who want to learn more about the power of ChatGPT. However, we want to make our application welcoming for people who are usually not interested in news about AI so that they can learn how technological advancement is changing their lives. Doing so, we want to spread awareness of how powerful ChatGPT is and how it can be a tool for real-world problems.</p>
        <p>Features we want to include are a true/false game that tests the user’s knowledge on ChatGPT. This might reveal how much the user knows about ChatGPT and can start a discussion on what people might assume ChatGPT can and can’t do. Because we believe that this topic will have a wide range of opinions and perspectives, we want to users to be able to post discussion posts about topics their interested in. Users can like and comment to contribute their opinions. Discussions can be tagged using our platform’s provided tags and filtered by topic or date posted. Our web application intends to educate people on ChatGPT and the continued growth of Language Learning Models.</p>
        <p>Our web application will be a way for users to truly understand what it means for a new technology to emerge, because when a new technology appears, so do new consequences and social issues that must be discussed. When more people start to understand its impacts, individually they may become more mindful of their actions that could contribute to such impacts, and overall be more responsible with technology.</p>
